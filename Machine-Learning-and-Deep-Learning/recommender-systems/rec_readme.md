# Content Recommendation System

This project implements a content recommendation system using a neural network model to provide personalized recommendations based on user interactions.
Originally, I developed this Recommendation System for an AI Platform with Hundreds of Thousands of Monthly Users
All proprietary language and specific details have been modified.

## Features

- **Custom Metrics**: Tracks requests, errors, response time, cache size, prediction latency, and model version.
- **Neural Network Model**: Includes a multi-head attention layer and a neural network for character recommendations.
- **Caching**: Uses in-memory caching with Redis fallback for efficient data retrieval.
- **Health Monitoring**: Enhanced health monitoring with auto-recovery mechanisms.
- **A/B Testing**: Supports A/B testing configuration and tracking.

## Installation

Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Set up your environment variables and configuration files as needed.

## Usage

1. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python recommendation_system.py --train
   ```

2. Get recommendations for a user:
   ```bash
   python recommendation_system.py --recommend --user_id <USER_ID>
   ```

## Example

To train the model and get recommendations:
```bash
python recommendation_system.py --train
python recommendation_system.py --recommend --user_id 123
```

## Dependencies

- Python
- PyTorch
- Redis
- Optuna
