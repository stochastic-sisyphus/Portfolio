# MSBA

----
This repository is less of a portfolio and more of a work in progress—a snapshot of my work in data science, machine learning, and statistical modeling. Some projects are polished, others are experiments that may or may not lead anywhere, and most sit somewhere in between.

I fell down the rabbit hole of translating abstract ideas into something functional—optimizing models, automating processes, and mostly just figuring out why the latest iteration broke.

## Repository Structure
A high-level view, but in reality, each directory is filled with experiments, half-finished ideas, and scripts that probably need refactoring.
